This is **_markdown_**.

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://google.com) to find things.

To make a list we can use the following <!--These are unordered lists-->

* This is item one
* This is item two
    * This is a subpoint in the list
        * This is a subpoint's subpoint

- This is another list
- We can use dashes instead of *s
<!--This is a mixed between ordered and unordered-->
1. This is item one
2. This is item two
    - This is a subpoint unter two
4. This is item three

# Blockquote

These are usually used to show quote, things that someone has said

It's useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines
